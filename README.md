Clean Architecture and Clean Code practices have been adopted in its development, as well as SOLID principles. The Atomic Design methodology has been applied for the design and componentization of the UI.

### `lib/src`
  - `core/`: Fundamental and shared elements of the app.
  - `core-ui/`: Common and reusable user interface elements.
  - `features/`: Different modules or features of the application, divided by functionality.

### `features/`

Each `feature` or module has its own structure:

```
|- feature/

      |- repositories/
  |- domain/
      |- models/
      |- repositories/
  |- presentation/
      |- screens/

### Prerequisites

Before installing the application, make sure you have the following installed:

- Flutter: You must have Flutter installed on your machine. To install Flutter, follow the instructions in the [Flutter Installation Guide](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install).
- Android Studio or Visual Studio Code: You need an IDE to run and test your application. Android Studio or Visual Studio Code are recommended. Make sure to install the Flutter and Dart plugins.
- A device or emulator: To run the application, you will need an Android or iOS device, or an emulator installed via your IDE.


### Installation

1. Clone the GitHub repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/davidgab98/my-movie-hub.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the main project folder and install all dependencies:
   ```sh
   cd my-movie-hub/my_movie_hub
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. Install all necessary dependencies for the UI package:
   ```sh
   cd ../ui/ui_kit
   flutter pub get
   cd ../../my_movie_hub
   ```

### Run

1. Make sure you have navigated to the main project folder:
   ```sh
   cd my-movie-hub/my_movie_hub
   ```

2. Use the following command in your terminal, replacing `<flavor>` with `development`, `staging`, or `production` and `<mode>` with `debug`, `profile`, or `release` as per your needs:

   ```sh
   flutter run --flavor <flavor> --target lib/main_<flavor>.dart --<mode>
   ```

   Alternatively, if you are using Visual Studio Code, you can select and run each configuration from the "Run and Debug" menu based on the `launch.json` file.
